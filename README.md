Let's Go

Go (often referred to as Golang) is a programming language created by Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is a statically typed, compiled language in the tradition of C, with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. The compiler, tools, and source code are all free and open source.

Prefer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language) for more on Golang.

Here are some of the reasons why you should learn Go:
• The go language is very concise, simple and safe.

• It’s compilation time is very fast.

• It supports the patterns which adapt to the surrounding environment similar to dynamic languages.

• It supports inbuilt concurrency such as lightweight processes channels and select statements.

• It supports the interfaces and the embedded types.

• It doesn’t require any external dependencies for the production of the statically linked native binaries.
